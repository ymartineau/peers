Maven

build lifecycles:
 - default
 - clean
 - site

1 lifecycle: n phases

default lifecycle main phases:
 - validate
 - compile
 - test
 - package
 - integration-test
 - verify
 - install
 - deploy

calling one phase automatically calls all previous phases.

1 phase: n goals

goals are independent tasks that can be bound to a phase or not

packaging defines the way goals and phases associated:

jar packaging:
 - process-resources: resources:resources
 - compile: compiler:compile
 - package: jar:jar
 - ...

plugins can tweak the way goals and phases are associated and can add new goals.
Goals executions defined by packaging are invoked first, then goals defined in
plugins.

In plugins, goals to be invoked must be declared explicitly. Nevertheless, goals
are automatically bound to a default phase. This default goal / phase
association can be modified in plugin definition.
