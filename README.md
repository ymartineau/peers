## SPECIFICATION


Peers is a software phone (softphone) compatible with the
following specifications:

- RFC 3261 (SIP),
- RFC 4566 (SDP),
- RFC 3550 (RTP),
- RFC 3551 (RTP Audio/Video profile),
- RFC 2617 (Digest Authentication),
- RFC 4733 (DTMF),
- ITU-T G.711 (PCMU, PCMA)

You should easily retrieve those specifications on internet with
your favorite search engine.


## PREREQUISITES


This software has been developed using Oracle Java Development Kit
version 7. You should install the latest Java Runtime Environment
on your computer if you just want to run the application. If you
want to compile the sources yourself, you should use the JDK. In
both cases, you can download the installation files here:
  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html


## CONFIGURATION


Your SIP account credentials can be configured in conf/peers.xml.
Please read comments in this file for configuration details.
This configuration file is ruled by a grammar file: peers.xsd.
Thus to modify this file, you can use jEdit with XML and Error list
plugins. You can download jEdit here:
  http://www.jedit.org/index.php?page=download
This provides xml completion and grammar checking which can be
very useful to avoid simple configuration errors.
You can also configure your SIP account using graphical user
interface.


## RUNNING


If you are a Windows user you can use the .bat batch script in root
directory, if you use any Unix compatible system, you can use the
.sh script. You can also double click .jar file. You can then call
any IP address using SIP protocol, if the remote host does not listen
on the default SIP port (5060), you can use the following example URI:

```
sip:192.168.1.2:6060
```

For some softphones, it is necessary to add a user part to the called
sip uri, for example:

```
sip:alice@192.168.1.2:6060
```

If you configured a sip account in configuration file or using gui,
you can also place calls with usual sip uris:
  sip:bob@biloxi.com

Advanced users can run several peers instances on the same computer.
In this case a folder should be created in peers root directory for
each peers instance. This folder should contain three directories:
conf, logs and media. conf should contain peers.xml and peers.xsd for this
instance. peers.xml will need to be updated with this instance
parameters, peers.xsd can be copied from root conf directory. You will
need to do this for each instance. <media> parameter in configuration file
should be activated for at most one peers instance, this avoids confusion
in microphone capture and sound playback. You should also check that
SIP and RTP ports are not the same in each configuration file.

Here is an example configuration:

```
  peers/
    user1/
      conf/
        peers.xml
        peers.xsd
      logs/
      media/
    user2/
      conf/
        peers.xml
        peers.xsd
      logs/
      media/
```

Once all those files have been created and updated, each instance can
be run providing a java system property giving peers home directory:

```
java -classpath build/classes -Dpeers.home=user1 net.sourceforge.peers.gui.MainFrame
```

As a Main-Class has been defined in jar manifest, you can also use the following
command line:

```
java -jar build/peers.jar -Dpeers.home=user1 net.sourceforge.peers.gui.MainFrame
```
